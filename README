App-OdinAuthorizer -- Authorization webapp for Apache2::Authen::OdinAuth

This is a Perl Dancer implementation of an authorizer webapp for
Apache2::Authen::OdinAuth, a cookie-based single sign-on system. It
calls back to Google Apps for Domains, and allows users who authorize
with email of a preconfigured domain.

INSTALLATION

To run this module, run the following commands:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build installdeps
        ./bin/app.pl

CONFIGURATION

Default values are provided in the config.yml file. For development or
review, you can stick with the defaults or customize the
environments/development.yml file. For production, prepare
environments/production.yml file (you can start based on the
environments/sample_production.yml example).

To use production settings, pass DANCER_ENVIRONMENT=production
environment variable to the app.pl script.

PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT

You don't really want to use ./bin/app.pl directly in production
settings. Recommended setup is to use Apache with mod_perl and the
Plack handler. Here is a sample Apache config file:

    <VirtualHost *:80>
      ServerName i.yourdomain.com
      DocumentRoot /srv/App-OdinAuthorizer/public
    
      SetHandler perl-script
      PerlHandler Plack::Handler::Apache2
      PerlSetVar psgi_app /srv/App-OdinAuthorizer/bin/app.pl
      SetEnv DANCER_ENVIRONMENT "production"
    
      <Location ~ "^/(?:[^/]+.(?:html|jpg|png|ico)$|bootstrap/|css/|js/)">
        SetHandler None
      </Location>
    </VirtualHost>
